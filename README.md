## <a name="about-this-project"></a> About this project
Tens of thousands of college students across the US travel abroad for internship or study abroad opportunities every year. With each of these opportunities typically come requirements from the university, internship program or personal goals the students would like to reach. Managing that inormation while in a foreign country can be tedious and challenging. 

Intl.Intern works to make managing and reaching goals and requirements easier than ever. Add requirements of the internship, study abroad program or personal goals to the app and track your progress by adding chapters to your journal and tying them to the requirements. Additionally, keep track of your expenses in the local currency and US dollars on the expenses. Finally, always know what is happening locally on the location page where you can view a local map, current weather, exchange rate, timezone information and local news.

mongo
```
 
 7. Install your Database Manager
 We used Robo 3T and MongoDB Compass. You can find information to download and install these [here](https://robomongo.org/) and [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?filter=enterprise&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=Americas_US_CorpEntOnly_Brand_Beta_FM&utm_keyword=%2Bcompass%20%2Bmongo%20%2Bdb&utm_device=c&utm_network=g&utm_medium=cpc&utm_creative=205021190835&utm_matchtype=b&_bt=205021190835&_bk=%2Bcompass%20%2Bmongo%20%2Bdb&_bm=b&_bn=g&jmp=search&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIi-P-kb762gIVQ16GCh3VrAGwEAAYASAAEgL1dvD_BwE#compass) respectively. 

8. Start your servers
This application has two servers:
1. The Express server 
2. The React development server
Once you have completed the above steps run the following command to start the application:
